 Classic Car Models Project

 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of classic and electric vehicles to explore trends, features, and characteristics of different car models. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about classic cars, alternative fuel vehicles, and electric vehicles across countries, states, and cities.

 Tools Used
- **Excel** – for data cleaning and organization  
- **SQL** – for querying and analyzing structured data  
- **Power BI** – for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations  

 Dataset Columns
The dataset includes the following columns:

- `vin` – Vehicle Identification Number  
- `1_10` – Rating / Score (if applicable)  
- `country` – Country of registration  
- `city` – City  
- `state` – State  
- `post_code` – Postal code  
- `model` – Car model  
- `year` – Year of manufacture  
- `electric_vehicle` – Indicates if the car is electric  
- `classic_vehicle` – Indicates if the car is a classic model  
- `clean_alternative_fuel_vehicle` – Alternative fuel / clean energy vehicle  
- `cav_electric_range` – Electric vehicle range (miles/kms)  
- `legislative_district` – District info (if applicable)  
- `dol_vehicle_id` – Department of Licensing vehicle ID  
- `vehicle_location` – Parking / registered location  
- `electric_utility` – Utility company for electric vehicles
